   <p>GymPrtnr is a web-based application based on the idea of bringing people together to enjoy physical activities.  After having spent
   many years going to the gym without a partner, I thought it would be
   nice to have means of meeting other folks that participate in the
   same activities as I do.<br>
   <br>
   GymPrtnr utilizes Rails as a backend, Angular.js and JQuery on the front-end,
   PostGres as a database.  This application was built as the third and final
   project during my coursework at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly">General Assembly</a></p>
